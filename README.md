# The Little Hackers Python GetEnv Library
Python utility library for accessing and managing environment variables.

This library relies on [`python-dotenv`](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to read key-value pairs from a `.env` file, which helps in the development of applications following the [12-factor principles](https://12factor.net/).

This library provides a helper function to convert the value of environment variables in the expected data type.
